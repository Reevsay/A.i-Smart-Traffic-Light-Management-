## 🌟 What Makes This Special?

Imagine traffic lights that actually *think*! This project combines cutting-edge AI technologies to create an intelligent traffic management system that adapts in real-time to traffic conditions. No more waiting at red lights when there's no traffic! 🎯

### 🔥 Key Features

- **🤖 Smart Detection**: Uses YOLOv8 to detect cars, trucks, buses, and motorcycles with high accuracy
- **👁️ Object Tracking**: Implements Deep SORT algorithm to track vehicles across video frames
- **🚦 Dynamic Traffic Lights**: Traffic lights change color based on real-time vehicle count analysis
- **📊 Real-time Analytics**: Live visualization of traffic flow and congestion patterns
- **⚡ High Performance**: Optimized for real-time processing of traffic footage
- **🎨 Visual Dashboard**: Interactive display showing vehicle counts, traffic lights, and timing

*The system in action - detecting vehicles, tracking their movement, and controlling traffic lights dynamically*

## 🧠 How It Works

```
📹 Video Input → 🔍 YOLOv8 Detection → 🎯 Deep SORT Tracking → 📊 Traffic Analysis → 🚦 Smart Light Control
```

1. **Video Processing**: Analyzes traffic footage frame by frame
2. **Vehicle Detection**: YOLOv8 identifies different types of vehicles with bounding boxes
3. **Object Tracking**: Deep SORT maintains unique IDs for each vehicle across frames
4. **Traffic Line Monitoring**: Counts vehicles crossing predefined traffic lines
5. **Smart Light Logic**: Dynamically adjusts traffic light colors based on congestion:
   - 🟢 **Green**: < 5 vehicles (Low traffic)
   - 🟡 **Yellow**: 5-9 vehicles (Moderate traffic)
   - 🔴 **Red**: ≥ 10 vehicles (High traffic)

## 🎯 Usage Examples

### Basic Traffic Analysis
```python
from ultralytics import YOLO
import cv2

# Load the trained model
model = YOLO('work/best.pt')

# Analyze traffic video
video_path = 'work/footage.mp4'
results = model(video_path)
```

### Custom Configuration
```python
# Modify traffic line positions in AiTrafficDetector.py
LINES = [
    ((220, 175), (470, 160)),  # Lane 1
    ((200, 175), (235, 260)),  # Lane 2
    ((490, 175), (625, 235)),  # Lane 3
    ((240, 275), (610, 240))   # Lane 4
]

# Adjust traffic light thresholds
def get_traffic_light_color(vehicle_count):
    if vehicle_count < 5:
        return 'green'
    elif 5 <= vehicle_count < 10:
        return 'yellow'
    else:
        return 'red'
```
